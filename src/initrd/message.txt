This project was created for fun and to gain a better 
knowledge of how the kernel works inside. 
Kernel code is divided into modules responsible for managing 
avaliable hardware, like cpu, memory and I/O system. 
I hope that included documentation will help you to understand 
how kernel modules works together to provide you a convinient
interface to your hardware. I also believe that is easier 
to understand that concept by studying a small kernel code 
(or even better by writting your own implementation of it),
than by wading through the huge code bases of today's kernels.

If you will find some factual errors please let me know.
